# Project Title

Using Angular, the client-side
interface is built for a single-page, responsive app that includes several interface views and that
handles data through the previously-defined REST API endpoints.

# Key Features
● Displaya a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an
account.
● Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies.
● On a particular movie card, users will be given options between links to the movie genre, director, and movie synopsis, as well as one that adds the movie to their favorites. When a user clicks on any of these links, a dialog should open that displays more details.
● Angular's router to implement a route for the welcome view, movie card view, and user profile view.

# User Stories
